# Project-Gutenberg-Analysis

In this project, we will do some interesting analysis on some of the most famous literature works while honing our skills working with strings, arrays, hash tables, trees, and more!

I selected the novel, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, to conduct my analysis.

In fact, I actually was Alice in Wonderland in my 5th Grade Play!
